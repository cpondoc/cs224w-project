    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome back to Relbench! In this tutorial, we'll dive a bit deeper into the benchmark + Relational Deep Learning and explore several choices around architecture, scale, and generalizability. In particular, we'll look to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can we train our Relational Deep Learning on one entity classification task and expect strong zero-shot performance on another entity classification task? What happens if we finetune the model?\n",
    "2. How does our choice of using embedding models to generate expressive node features impact our performance on node classification tasks?\n",
    "3. How can we alter and/or extend the architecture of our existing Relational Deep Learning model to improve performance on different tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook already assumes you've looked through the tutorials on [loading in data](https://github.com/snap-stanford/relbench/blob/main/tutorials/load_data.ipynb) and [training a model](https://github.com/snap-stanford/relbench/blob/main/tutorials/train_model.ipynb), as our walkthrough uses those guides as a launchpad to explore deeper questions.

In the Relbench tutorial, the team uses GloVe embeddings, but the paper also mentions utilizing BERT-style embeddings. In traditional NLP, BERT embeddings are much more popular given that they are contextual -- the vector representation depends on the surrounding words, compared to static embeddings used by GloVe -- and can handle words outside of their vocabulary. In addition, their embedding size is $768$ compared to GloVe's $300$, which introduces an opportunity for more expressiveness."
